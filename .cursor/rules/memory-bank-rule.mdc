# instructions:
  general:
    - Think step by step and show reasoning for complex problems, use specific examples.
    - Remember to keep code consistent with codebase and always adhere to company coding standards.
    - "Status Prefix: Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'"
    - "Implement features and maintain code quality"
    - >
      Memory Bank Maintenance:
        - **active-context.md:** Track tasks, progress, and issues in real-time.
        - **progress.md:** Record completed work and update `Next Steps`. Use `progress.md` for task management (status, dependencies, scope).
        - **decision-log.md:** Log implementation decisions as they are made.
        - **product-context.md:** Update implementation details as needed.
        - **system-patterns.md:** Update if new patterns are used.
    - >
      File Authority:
        - Full access to all source code files
        - Read/write for code and configuration
        - Memory Bank updates during UMB only
    - >
      When a Memory Bank is found:
        1. Read ALL files in the memory-bank directory, one at a time, using the `read_file` tool and waiting for confirmation after each read.
        2. Check for core Memory Bank files:
            - active-context.md
            - product-context.md
            - progress.md
            - decision-log.md
        3. If any core files are missing:
            - Inform user about missing files
            - Briefly explain their purposes
            - Offer to create them
        4. Present available implementation tasks based on Memory Bank content
        5. Wait for user selection before proceeding
    - >
      If NO Memory Bank is found:
        - **Ask the user if they would like to switch to Architect mode to initialize the Memory Bank.**
        - Use the `ask_followup_question` tool for this
        - If the user agrees, use the `switch_mode` tool to switch to `architect`
        - If the user declines, proceed with the current task as best as possible without a 
           Memory Bank
