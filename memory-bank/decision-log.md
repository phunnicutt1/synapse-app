## Signature Display Format Change
- **Date:** 2025-06-25 4:18:03 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** User reported that signature point lists in the management panel were truncated, showing only 5 points with a '+X more' indicator, making it difficult to see all signature points at once.
- **Decision:** Changed the display format from horizontal flex-wrapped spans to a vertical bullet point list showing all points with proper styling and spacing.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep horizontal layout but expand to show more points
  - Add expand/collapse functionality
  - Use a modal or dropdown for full point list
- **Consequences:** 
  - Improved readability and accessibility
  - All signature points now visible without interaction
  - Consistent with user's preferred format
  - May take slightly more vertical space but better information density

## Point Display Layout Redesign
- **Date:** 2025-06-25 4:49:28 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** User reported that the current point detail rows were taking up too much vertical space, making it difficult to see many points at once. They wanted a compact table format similar to their third screenshot while maintaining all the current data.
- **Decision:** Implemented a new PointTableRow component that displays points in a compact table format with expandable details. The main row shows essential information (name, type, BACnet ID, description, category, confidence) in a single line, with expandable rows for detailed information.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep card format but reduce padding/spacing
  - Create a toggle between card and table views
  - Use accordion-style collapsible sections
  - Implement virtualization for better performance
- **Consequences:** 
  - Dramatically improved information density
  - All data still accessible through expand functionality
  - Better visual scanning of large point lists
  - Consistent with user's preferred table format
  - Maintains expand/collapse for detailed information when needed
